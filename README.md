Task Details:
Home page will have a Header (simple navbar), Banner, Tools/Parts, Business Summary, Reviews, and Footer. The tools/parts will have either 3 or 6 tools/parts. Based on your design, you can put one or more tools/parts in a row. Each tool/part should have a relevant name, image, short description, minimum order quantity, available quantity, price (per unit price), a place order/purchase/book now/ buy now button. If a user clicks on the purchase or buy now button it will take the user to the purchase page.

Add two different sections on the home page and the 6 sections mentioned above. Tips: This is the place to shine. Add something different and unique to make your website looks different than others. And Make them relevant to your website. And make these two sections meaningful.

The business summary will show some summary of your business. There could be 3/4 summary on this summary section. For example, we served 100+ customers, 120M+ Annual revenue, 33K+ Reviews, 50+ tools, etc. Make sure you use some relevant icons here. You can use Hero Icons, React Icons, Font Awesome, Bootstrap Icons, Daisy UI or any icons that you like. To see an example, you will find an image in the images folder of this repository.

The `purchase' page will be a private/protected route. Please make sure that the private route redirects to the login page if the user is not logged in. After login, the user will be redirected to the page he/she wanted to go to. Also, after reloading the page of a private/protected route, the user is not redirected to the login page. The purchase page should display detailed information about the item the user has clicked somewhere at the top. It will also display the user's name and email address from the login system. The user will have a field to provide an address, phone number, and other necessary information (if applicable) to place the order or complete the purchase.

Please do not block the user if the email is not verified for our assignment evaluation purpose. Because it will stop the assignment evaluation if the email sending is not working, if you want, you can enforce this after receiving assignment marks.

On the Purchase page, users will be able to change the order quantity (increase/decrease) in an input field. The initial value of the quantity will be the minimum order quantity. However, the user won't be able to reduce the quantity below the minimum order quantity mentioned on the tool/part. Also, the order quantity can not be higher than the available quantity. You will display an error and disable the purchase button in both cases.

Implement an email/ password (login/Register) based login system. The registration form should have the name, and once a user is logged in, the user name and the logout button should appear on the header, which will log out the user once clicked. Implement at least one social login system (google, facebook, or github, etc.). Make sure to display login-related errors and password validation-related errors.

If a user is logged in, they will see another option on the header is called Dashboard. Inside the dashboard, a user (not an admin) will see options like My Orders, Add A Review, My Profile options on the side nav. This is the time to implement a nested route. Based on your website idea, you can change the name of these menu items. The My Profile link will be open for everyone. This means every user will be able to see my profile link and update their profile.
(done)

On My Orders page, the logged-in user will see only their orders. If the user wants, they should be able to cancel (canceling is just deleting the order) any order that is not paid yet. Ask for a confirmation message before canceling an order. Do not use browser default confirm. Instead, use a good-looking modal. Please note users will not see the cancel option for any paid order.

On the My Orders page, there will be a payment button for each order. The user has not paid yet. The pay button will take the user to the payment page. The user should be able to pay by using a credit card here. The payment page will display order details. Once the payment is completed for an order, the user will see the transaction id for that order on the my orders page.

On the Add A Review page, users should be able to add a review. A review will contain ratings ( a number 1 to 5 and a description). That review will appear on the home page reviews section. Right now, you will see every review on the home page. There is no limit on the number of reviews or the order of the review.
(done)
The My profile route will be available for every user (admin or non-admin. everyone will see this link). The user will see their name and email address on this profile in this link. Also, this page will have fields to add fields like education, location (city/district), phone number, LinkedIn profile link, etc. And users will be able to save this information in the database. Also, the user will be able to update this information.
(done)

If an admin logs in, they will not see the options that a user sees except My Profile. This means an admin will not see my orders and add a review link. Instead, an admin will see My Profile, Manage All Orders, Add A Product, Make Admin, Manage Products. Based on your website idea, you can change the name of these menu names. Manage products will be described in the bonus section.
.......

An Admin should be able to make another user an admin. If an admin wants, they will be able to add a product on the add a product page. After adding the product, this product will appear on the home page. Please note, to add an image for a new product; you can just upload the image directly to the image hosting sites like imgbb, etc using API. Alternatively, you can have an input field to add the link to the image.

One route will be Blogs. This will be a open route (anyone visiting your website will see it). Please answer at least five questions on the blogs page. We recommend answering all six questions.

14.1 How will you improve the performance of a React Application?

14.2 What are the different ways to manage a state in a React application?

14.3 How does prototypical inheritance work?

14.4 Why you do not set the state directly in React. For example, if you have const [products, setProducts] = useState([]). Why you do not set products = [...] instead, you use the setProducts

14.5 You have an array of products. Each product has a name, price, description, etc. How will you implement a search to find products by name?

14.6 What is a unit test? Why should write unit tests?

On the Manage All Orders page for the admin, the logged-in admin will see the orders placed by every user. If multiple users use this website to place orders, everyone's order will be displayed here. The orders that are not paid will show unpaid. And the orders that are paid, an Admin can update the status of a paid order. After placing an order and completing the payment, every order will have a default status: pending. On the Manage All Orders page, an admin will be able to update the status of the pending to shipped status. This could be a simple button to update the pending status. (don't overthink, this is a simple button to update the status field of the order. Use Id to find the order and set the status to approved). Also, the admin will be able to cancel (cancel means admin can delete an order) that is not paid yet. Make sure to add a confirmation before deleting.

Implement the basic version of the jwt token. Upon login, you will create a jwt token and store it on the client-side, and for the necessary pages, you will send the token with the call and verify the user. Implementing 401 and 403 is optional.

Similarly, you will need to protect the admin route and on the server side verify the admin level api requests.
